Replacing a google form with this crud... Because I'm a simple man with simple needs...

This project uses **pipe** to comunicate with the host through the included pipe_line.sh script.
A pipe must be created at (root)/pipe in the local host to receive commands from the docker... what can possible go wrong with it... The point is to allow IPTABLES be managed by the app... Again, what can possile goes wrong, right? RIGHT?
